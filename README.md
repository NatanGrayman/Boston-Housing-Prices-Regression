# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## Overview

This project is a solution to the Kaggle competition ["House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview), through a collaborative effort with fellow students, conducted under the guidance of [Prof. Vered Aharonson](https://www.wits.ac.za/people/academic-a-z-listing/a/veredaharonsonwitsacza/) and achieved a grade of 90%.

## Project Description

This notebook is intended to be a practical project for an introductory machine learning course, predicting the sale prices of each home in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes. The dataset used is the Ames Housing dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.

### Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Selection:** Implementing and comparing linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Random Forest models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate and compare model performance.
- **Visualization:** Employing various visualization techniques to explore and present findings.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
