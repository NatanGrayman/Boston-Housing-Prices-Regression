![House Prices](https://kaggle2.blob.core.windows.net/competitions/kaggle/5407/media/housesbanner.png)

## Overview

This project is a solution to the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." In this competition, participants are challenged to predict the final price of each home in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes. This project was a collaborative effort with fellow students, conducted under the guidance of [Prof. Vered Aharonson's](https://www.wits.ac.za/people/academic-a-z-listing/a/veredaharonsonwitsacza/) , The achieved a grade of 90%.  

## Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to apply advanced machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset. By doing so, we aim to improve our skills in creative feature engineering and advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting.

## Project Description

This notebook is intended to be a practical project for an introductory machine learning course, predicting the sale prices of houses based on various features. The dataset used is the Ames Housing dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.

### Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Selection:** Implementing and comparing linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Random Forest models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate and compare model performance.
- **Visualization:** Employing various visualization techniques to explore and present findings.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
